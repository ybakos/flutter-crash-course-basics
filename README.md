# Flutter Crash Course 1: Basics

My implementation of Nick Manning's app from the [Flutter Crash Course 1: Basics](https://fluttercrashcourse.com).

## Development

The app uses some codegen a la json_serializable, json_annotation, and build_runner.
These generated files are not in the repo, so be sure to generate them:

```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
